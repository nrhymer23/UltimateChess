# UltimateChess
     Our Project is a variation of the traditional chess game that serves to add some probability to the game in addition to the reasoning already needed. The game is to perform the same as traditional chess but with changes in the way some pieces can move and some additional instructions when attempting to capture a piece. In order to capture a piece a roll  from a die is introduced where there is some uncertainty to if attempt will be successful. This game serves those who enjoy the traditional chess but is open to an interesting twist within the game. All that is required is a basic understanding of the game and an open mind.
